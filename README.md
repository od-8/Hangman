# Hangman

Hangman is a game about guessing a word within a certain number of guesses.
I wrote this project in ruby and it runs in the command line.

This file also has the ability to save the game at any point and open an old game before you start playing.
Also every game it generates a new word from the 'google-10000-english-no-swears.txt' file provided by the Odin Project

This is for the Odin Projects Hangman project.
